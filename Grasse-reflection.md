# Justin's GPS 1.1 Reflection

1. In the workflow of Git, I had many questions as to the best practices of when to delete branches and how often to create branches.
2. I learned how to merge conflicts.  It clickeduuch quicker just walking through it once.
3. I asked why the git fetch was used and why it would be necessary instead of git pull.
4. I'm still walking on eggshells a bit, just making sure I don't call the wrong command.  This GPS definitely help me feel comfortable with the workflow and falling back on Git to control the process and prevent goof-ups since that's what it's **intended** to do.
5. Unconventional.  I had no pair, so it was solo tutoring session which worked out well, but part of the experience was lost.  Looking forward to my next first official GPS.
